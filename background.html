        <h2>Job history</h2>
        <p>What can I say? I held many jobs over the years. I had worked packing and shipping. I canvased
          the streets. I lead a team during the 2010 census. I made sushi rolls. I set up server hardware
          in data centers. I even washed dishes at a local bar. Each job had it's benefits and perks for
           the time but none of them were as technical as I would like.</p>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <blockquote><p>I know that I know nothing</p><footer>Play-doh</footer></blockquote>
        <h2>Why I want to program</h2>
        <p>I would like to create in general. Why specifically programming? What would programming have
           over other creative fields? Utility, probably. I can not think of any other field that combines
            creativity and utility while also being an evolving iterative skillset. One day one of us
             might write a short rule for some piece of technology that utterly changes the path of
             humanity.</p>
